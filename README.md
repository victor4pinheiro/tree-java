# Getting Started

<a name="technologies"></a>
## Technologies

* [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) >= 8

<a name="prerequisites"></a>
## Prerequisites

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* An IDE or a text editor (for this project I suggest [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/));

<a name="structure"></a>
## Folder Structure

The workspace need to contain two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies (you need to create because I don't have any dependencies)

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

# How to use
